## What is Galaga Remastered?
Galaga Remastered is like the classic arcade Galaga that you may have seen growing up as a kid.  It is a one player game where the player controls a space ship
and shoots missiles at enemy ships_. If your missiles_have_been_drawn_ hit the enemy ships_ they get destroyed and the players score_ goes up. If enemy ships_ hit your ship you lose a life.
If you lose all three lives_ the game is over. You can move up, down, right and left and you can shoot missles using the space bar.

## How to build and play Galaga Remasterd

To play this game, you will need CLion, Cinder and Box2D. First, you will need
to get JetBrains C++ IDE: CLion. If you do not already have it,
you can get it at this link, https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/. You will
also need to download Cinder which is available at this link, https://libcinder.org/download.
Once you have Cinder, you must build the Cinder library. To do this, first, 
take the download Cinder file and open it in CLion. Then click the build button
near the top of the screen that looks like a hammer. It may take a while,
but it will build the library. Now, you must create a directory
in Cinder for your projects. Once you have that directory, you can clone this
project into that directory. Finally, you can run and play the game!
